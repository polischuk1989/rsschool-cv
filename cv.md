#### About me:
I am a beginner frontend developer, I really like this profession. My strong point is the desire and ability to learn. For me, this profession is like a puzzle that needs to be solved no matter how difficult it is. I took a frontend development course at geekbrains, but after I found out that RS School graduates are in demand among employers, I decided to join the community. And here I am.

                if (num % i == 0) {
                    arrDivisors.push(i);
                }
            }
            return arrDivisors;
        }

            for (let elem of arr) {
                sum += elem;
            } return sum;
        }

        function getPerfect(startNum, endNum) {
            let result = [];
            for (let i = startNum; i <= endNum; i++) {
                if (i == getSum(getOwnDivisors(i))) {
                    result.push(i);
                }
            } return result;
        }
